# Starter Plugin

This is a [YOOtheme Pro](https://yootheme.com) plugin for Joomla/WordPress. It is a minimal example plugin that can be used as a starting point for your own plugin development.

## Getting Started

After you have installed PHP and Composer, you create a new plugin project via Composer's create-project command. This will create a new `my-plugin` directory with the plugin files.

```bash
composer create-project yootheme/starter-plugin my-plugin
```

To run build tasks you need to install [Task](https://taskfile.dev) via Node and npm or use another [installation method](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) of your choice.

```bash
npm install -g @go-task/cli
```
